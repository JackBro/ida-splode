# IDA Splode

A tool that I wrote to help reversing on Windows.  Also proof that I am bad at coming up with catchy names.

## Requirements

- `%PIN_HOME%` points to an installation of Intel's Pin.
- MongoDB
- IDA Pro
- VS 2010

## Usage

- Run build.bat from a MSVC 2010 console
- Optionally, enable page heap for test.exe
- Run release.bat to trace the test.exe program in release mode
- Start MongoDB
- Run `demo.exe.py` to import the traces
- Start IDA Pro, open `demo.exe`
- Run `py\idapython_script.py` from within IDA
- If everything worked, `ida-splode` should automatically recognize all traces for the open binary from the database, and present a list of options.
- Press any of the hotkeys presented to do `${things}`.  
    - The slides should give you a good idea what is avaiable.
    - `Ctrl+Shift+H` reprints the help message

## Presentation

See the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/zachriggle/ida-splode/raw/master/slides/slides.pdf) in `slides/` for some examples on the sample application.  I've also included an `.idb` that shows some of the features.  All comments are auto-generated by the tool.  The only input I provided was to give the structures a name, and to select various interesting instructions.

## Caveats

This is pulled from a working copy, so some things may not work properly.  If you run into any issues, feel free to contact me at [@ebeip90](https://twitter.com/ebeip90) or ebeip90 on Freenode.net.
